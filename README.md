# Working With Webpack

This project is split into two separate folders.
Both will be setup and run in the following manner.
Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Demo
This is the demo portion of the repository.

### Demo Walkthrough
I'm going to assume that you know the basics of how the `package.json` works.

## Debug
This is the debug portion of the repository, things intentionally are broken here.
i.e. running `npm run build` will fail.
